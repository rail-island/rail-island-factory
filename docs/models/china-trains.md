## Deviations

- **Width.** The high-speed trains' 3.36 - 3.38 m bodies are narrowed to the Shinkansen
  gauge's 3.3 m, as the Shinkansen are.
- **Couplers.** The box locomotives carry the kit's buffers; China's are automatic couplers.
- **HXD1.** One 35.2 m body on eight axles; its two sections' joint is not drawn.
- **CR200J.** The power cars are the series kit's end cars, with windows.

## Tests

`test/worldTrains.test.ts` (all 160 plan designs) and, for each module's first design,
the catalog sweep.
