Their kits, figures, deviations and tests.

## Deviations

- **Metre gauge.** The RhB and MGB stock keeps its real 2.65 m bodies on the game's
  standard-gauge wheelsets, as the KiHa 40 does; the HGe 4/4 II's rack pinions are
  not drawn.
- **Crocodiles.** The Ce 6/8 II's and the Ge 6/6 I's hoods are drawn at the cab's width
  (the `hoods` nose type) on two three-axle groups; the side rods are not drawn.
- **Ae 8/14.** One 34 m body on its eight driving axles in four groups; the articulation
  between its two halves and the six idle guiding axles are left out.
- **Glacier Express.** The panorama roof is drawn as the dark roof band over tall windows.
- **FV-Dosto.** Measured from a near side view of the cab end and the upper windows' 1.5 m pitch: the
  black sweep's back edge one straight line from the white's point 1.4 m behind the tip to the shoulder
  at 6.75 m, the red over the roof's edge (livery `endRoofEdge`) to 7.7 m; on the cab's sides the dark
  band and the white's point are painted forward to the red. The doors stand at the low floor's ends
  inside the bogies (series `layout`): the end car's at 9.35 m and 17.6 m behind the tip with three lower
  windows between, the intermediate car's 5.2 m in from each end with seven; white service doors over the
  bogies, and behind the cab the destination display and the service door with its window and grille
  (series `sidePanels`). The pantograph stands on each end car's roof 5 m behind the tip (`pantographD`),
  the trailing one folded (`trailingLowered`). The upper deck's windows sit in the grey band as the user
  asked, though the photographs show white between them. The distant model draws only the lower window
  row's span, now short on the end car.
