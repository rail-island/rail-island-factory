## Deviations

- **Metre gauge.** The RhB and MGB stock keeps its real 2.65 m bodies on the game's
  standard-gauge wheelsets, as the KiHa 40 does; the HGe 4/4 II's rack pinions are
  not drawn.
- **Crocodiles.** The Ce 6/8 II's and the Ge 6/6 I's hoods are drawn at the cab's width
  (the `hoods` nose type) on two three-axle groups; the side rods are not drawn.
- **Ae 8/14.** One 34 m body on its eight driving axles in four groups; the articulation
  between its two halves and the six idle guiding axles are left out.
- **Glacier Express.** The panorama roof is drawn as the dark roof band over tall windows.
- **EW IV.** Measured on photographs of the B 50 85 21-95 149-3 and the A 50 85 10-95 031-6 (2021) and orthographic
  side views of models (assets/sbb-ew4-coach): 26.4 m over the buffers, the bogies 18.6 m apart (both painted on the
  car); the swing-plug doors 1.4-2.35 m in from each end with an end window (a louvred vent at its foot) and the class
  panel beside them; ten 1.36 m windows between the doors in first class, eleven 1.42 m in second; the window band
  2.03-3.1 m, the ribbed roof with rounded end caps and an air intake on one cap a side, UIC rubber-roll gangways.
  `redGrey` (titled "White and red") is the white-red-black livery of the 2000s (the window band red at the ends,
  grey skirt and end walls), `sbb` the 2021 repaint (red doors, black ends and skirt, a red line under the roof),
  `greenGrey` the 1981 fir green with stone-grey bands; first class adds its yellow strip. The windows' rounded
  corners are drawn square; the SBB emblem is simplified to a cross with two arrowheads.
